\f0\fs24 \cf0 The difference between n and n-1:\
The initial 0s in n will be replaced by 1s in (n-1), the first 1 in n will be replaced by 0 in (n-1).\
If n & (n-1) == 0, it means that there\'92s only one 1 in n, which is the power of 2 or n = 0.\
In a word, the function of the equation is to check whether n is the power of 2 or n = 0.}
