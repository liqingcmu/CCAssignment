\f0\fs24 \cf0 	There are 64 squares in the 8 * 8 chessboard, which are composed of 32 black squares and 32 white squares. When two diagonally opposite corners (which are the same color) are cut off, the chessboard is 30 black squares and 32 white squares OR 32 black squares and 30 white squares. \
	Each domino will take white color and one black color, which means 31 dominos will take 31 black squares and 31 white squares. Hence the present situation of the chessboard can\'92t be filled out completely by dominos.}
