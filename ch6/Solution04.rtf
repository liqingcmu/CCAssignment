\f0\fs24 \cf0 There\'92re three situations where two ants have collision.\
Each collision is happened in one of the three edges (suppose the edges be A, B, C, the ants/vertexes be a,b,c) of the triangle. A is the edge between a and b. B is the edge between b and c. C is the edge between a and c. P=P(collision happened at A between a and b)+P(collision happened at B between b and c)+P(collision happened at C between a and c) = P(a heads b)*P(b heads a)+P(b heads c)*P(c heads b)+P(a heads c)*P(c heads a) = 1/2*1/2+1/2*1/2+1/2*1/2=3/4}
